1. Data Ingestion & Preparation
   - Source: DRIVE dataset
   - Steps:
     - Load data using `deeplake`
     - Split into train, validation, and test sets
     - Augment and preprocess data (e.g., resizing, normalization)
   - Tools:
     - Python libraries (e.g., Torch, Albumentations)

2. Version Control
   - Push your code, configurations, and scripts to GitHub
   - Steps:
     - Use `git` for version control
     - Maintain separate branches for development, testing, and production
   - Tools:
     - Git, GitHub

3. CI/CD with Jenkins
   - Steps:
     - Set up Jenkins pipeline
     - Automate:
       - Running unit tests for the model
       - Building Docker images
       - Triggering MLOps workflows
   - Tools:
     - Jenkins

4. Dockerization
   - Steps:
     - Create a `Dockerfile` for the project
     - Include dependencies (PyTorch, DeepLake, MLflow, etc.)
     - Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub
   - Tools:
     - Docker, Docker Hub

5. Experiment Tracking with MLflow
   - Steps:
     - Log metrics, hyperparameters, and models during training
     - Use MLflow tracking server to monitor experiments
     - Register best models for deployment
   - Tools:
     - MLflow Tracking Server

6. Model Training & Validation
   - Steps:
     - Train the U-Net model on DRIVE data
     - Validate using metrics like Dice coefficient, accuracy, etc.
     - Optimize and fine-tune model hyperparameters
   - Tools:
     - PyTorch, NVIDIA CUDA, AMP (for mixed precision)

7. Model Packaging and Deployment
   - Steps:
     - Package the model for inference using `torchscript` or ONNX
     - Deploy on Kubernetes cluster
   - Tools:
     - Kubernetes, Helm

8. Monitoring & Feedback Loop
   - Steps:
     - Monitor deployed model with MLflow (drift detection, performance monitoring)
     - Retrain or fine-tune the model as needed
   - Tools:
     - MLflow, Prometheus, Grafana
